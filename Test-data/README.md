The PyMIMOX can get the chain information after you open the target protein PDB file, and the user need to input the mimotopes into the input box, then the user can get the prediction of the epitopes.

#The fellow is a example:
  1:target protein PDB files(1YCR);
  2:input-sequences.txt(BDB ID:1817; PMID:19255450)
  

#The file of Test data.xlsx is the whole dataset that you can user to test the software, also you can get the whole data at:http://immunet.cn/bdb/index.php
